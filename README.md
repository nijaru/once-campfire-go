# once-campfire-go

Campfire in Go, ported from [ONCE Campfire in Rust](https://github.com/basecamp/once-campfire-rust).
It uses the Go standard library for routing, HTTP, templates, SQL access, cryptography and process
lifecycle. There is no web framework, ORM, dependency injection container or frontend framework added
by the port. The original Turbo/Stimulus/Lexxy frontend is retained.

The application includes setup and invitations, sign-in and session transfers, account and user
administration, open/closed/direct rooms, messages and attachments, editing/deletion, boosts,
mentions, search, notifications, bot APIs/webhooks, link previews, Web Push, and Action Cable
presence, typing, read/unread and live updates. It includes media processing, the public HTTP/TLS
front server, automatic certificates, production packaging and backup/restore hooks.

SQLite schema, storage keys/layout, password hashes and Rails signed/encrypted cookies are preserved.
An upgrade test checks Go and Rust cookies in both directions and Rust reading/searching Go-written
messages. The port is functionally implemented; **strict HTML/network parity is not complete**.
See [validation](plans/validation.md) and the known differences below before replacing an installation.
The pinned Rust source is in `reference/`, with its Rails source in `reference/reference/`.

## Dependencies

- Go 1.27.1: `net/http`, `html/template`, `database/sql`, `crypto`, `encoding/json`, `embed`, `testing`.
- `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`: SQLite with FTS5, through CGO.
- `github.com/coder/websocket`: WebSocket transport; the Action Cable protocol and channels are local code.
- `golang.org/x/crypto`: bcrypt and ACME. The pinned revision includes the upstream ACME missing-Location fix.
- `golang.org/x/net`: HTTP/2 and HTML tokenization; a local tree-builder fork matches the reference parser.
- `golang.org/x/text`: indirect Unicode support.
- Native libvips, ffmpeg/ffprobe and libzstd: image/video processing and public HTTP zstd compression.

A local build needs a C compiler, pkg-config, libvips and libzstd development headers, ffmpeg, and
Python 3 for asset generation. Assets are built from the pinned sources without Ruby, Rust or Node.
The Dockerfile pins the reference media toolchain: libvips 8.16.1 and ffmpeg 7.1.5.

## Run

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
bin/build
export SECRET_KEY_BASE="$(openssl rand -hex 64)"
DISABLE_SSL=1 HTTP_PORT=8080 ./campfire server
```

Open <http://localhost:8080/first_run>. Keep the same `SECRET_KEY_BASE` across restarts; use an
existing installation's secret to retain logins when migrating its database and files.

```sh
docker build -t once-campfire-go .
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 -e DISABLE_SSL=1 -e SECRET_KEY_BASE \
  -v campfire-go-storage:/rails/storage once-campfire-go
```

The container runs as uid/gid 1000. For a bind mount, make its storage writable by that user.
`CAMPFIRE_STORAGE_PATH` defaults to `storage`, with databases in `db/`, media in `files/`, backups
in `backups/`, and certificate cache in `thruster/`. `CAMPFIRE_DATABASE_PATH` and `CAMPFIRE_FILES_PATH`
override individual locations; `RAILS_ENV` defaults to `production`. `campfire db:prepare` initializes
an empty database and checks migration versions; existing databases missing migrations are rejected.

The public listener uses `HTTP_PORT=80`. Set `TLS_DOMAIN` for automatic ACME certificates and HTTPS
on `HTTPS_PORT=443`. The internal application listener defaults to `TARGET_BIND=127.0.0.1` and
`TARGET_PORT=3000`. The front server provides HTTP/2, optional H2C, gzip/zstd with compression jitter,
a bounded response cache and graceful shutdown. `campfire backup` writes an atomic SQLite snapshot;
the image provides ONCE's `/hooks/pre-backup` and `/hooks/post-restore` hooks.

## Validation

```sh
bin/check                              # gofmt, assets, vet, all tests with the race detector
bin/check-assets                       # asset digests/importmap
bin/check-upgrade --rust-root ../once-campfire-rust
node bin/check-browser.mjs
bin/check-screens --out .cache/screens --only '**'
bin/check-acme
bin/check-container --image once-campfire-go:verification
```

The browser/upgrade tools use the Rust checkout's parity seed and installed Playwright. Screen
comparison runs both binaries on disposable copies of each seed, recording their hashes and keeping
the original parity masks. Reports distinguish screenshots, accessibility, server/live DOM, network
responses and Cable traffic. There are no Go-specific allowlists hiding failures.

Package tests use temporary databases and do not silently skip integration tests for a missing seed.
They include Rails signing/encryption and serialization vectors, 658 rich-text cases, 385 user-agent
cases, QR codes, route recognition, storage/ranges, transactions, access control, Cable, jobs,
90 Open Graph cases, 19 webhook cases and Web Push encryption/local delivery. Media metadata tests
run locally; byte-for-byte output tests require the pinned container toolchain:

```sh
docker build --target toolchain -t once-campfire-go:toolchain .
mkdir -p .cache/tmp .cache/docker-go-build .cache/docker-go-mod
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD:/src" -w /src \
  -e GOCACHE=/src/.cache/docker-go-build -e GOMODCACHE=/src/.cache/docker-go-mod \
  -e TMPDIR=/src/.cache/tmp once-campfire-go:toolchain \
  go test -tags 'sqlite_fts5 media_vectors' ./internal/storage
```

`bin/build` and `bin/check` use mise when Go is absent from PATH and keep temporary build files in
`.cache/`. Live ACME is tested against a local Pebble CA, including restart with the CA offline.
Container verification exercises setup, a live SQLite backup, offline restore, and restart.

## Benchmarks

This fork fixes the room refresh cursor and reuses completed authenticated GET gzip bodies.
In a controlled Linux/arm64 VM comparison, gzip throughput improved 1.95× for unchanged rooms,
2.81× for history, and 1.72× for search; identity throughput was roughly unchanged. Sidebar
throughput did not improve. These are not native AMD or Go/Rust comparisons. See the
[fork measurement and reproduction report](bench/results/prepared-gzip-20261005/README.md)
for raw results, active rooms, cache misses, memory costs, compressor trials and limitations.
A [follow-up part-identity iteration](bench/results/part-identity-20261005/README.md) improved
room, active-room and history gzip throughput another 24%, 60% and 82% over that prepared
build, with identity results roughly unchanged.

The [upstream comparison](bench/results/optimization-next-20261003/README.md) measures the
initial Go version, optimized upstream Go, and Rust in three rotating runs. Median
requests/sec at 16 HTTP clients, with identical seed data and four application CPUs:

| Workload | Initial Go | Optimized upstream Go | Change | Rust |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Room page | 10,175 | 15,218 | +49.6% | 27,535 |
| Message history | 21,445 | 21,369 | -0.4% | 31,139 |
| Sidebar | 24,423 | 24,658 | +1.0% | 38,303 |
| Search | 14,817 | 14,841 | +0.2% | 30,807 |
| Post message | 4,025 | 5,036 | +25.1% | 7,740 |

The historical sidebar row is not an equivalent Go/Rust workload: Go returns a bare frame
where the reference wraps a layout. See the known differences below; no full-page sidebar
performance comparison is established by those numbers.

Room-page p99 latency fell from 5.69 to 4.14 ms; message-write p99 fell from 16.03 to
12.49 ms. In that comparison, Rust was 1.81× faster on room pages and 1.54× faster on writes. All nine
application runs completed with zero HTTP errors, 345,913 acknowledged writes verified
in both messages and FTS, and nine thumbnails with identical bytes. HTTP memory use was
essentially unchanged. See the [raw report](bench/results/optimization-next-20261003/application/report.md)
for ranges, latency, resource measurements and limitations.

That upstream pass did not remeasure Cable throughput. In the
[earlier full-workload comparison](bench/results/application-optimized-20261003/report.md),
compressed broadcasts to 10,000 clients measured 21.1 complete messages/sec for Go and
39.3 for Rust. Final workload Pss was 1,023 MiB versus 408 MiB. Those measurements include
large WebSocket workloads and must not be compared directly with the upstream HTTP-only
memory figures. The earlier run had zero HTTP errors and complete Cable delivery;
[interrupted attempts](bench/results/application-optimized-20261003/CONTENTION.md) were
excluded and restarted. The [first optimization report](bench/results/optimization-20261003/comparison.md)
retains the original-port comparison.

These numbers compare these implementations on this workstation, not languages in general.

```sh
# Build both release binaries and Rust's bench/loadgen; prepare its parity seed.
bin/build
bench/application --out bench/results/my-run --reps 3 --seconds 5 \
  --concurrency 1 16 64 --cable-clients 100 1000 10000 --deflate 0 1
```

The harness alternates applications, uses fresh identical seed copies, fixes server/client CPU
sets and four application workers, and warms each HTTP workload. It validates message/room IDs,
static/avatar bytes, every successful write and FTS entry, complete Cable fan-out, and actual thumbnail
bytes. Reports include raw samples, source/binary hashes, toolchains, load averages and limitations.
HTTP measurements use the direct application listener and identity encoding; public TLS/compression
throughput is not measured in that upstream comparison. The fork harness also supports
`--listener public --gzip 1`, named candidates and concurrent active-room writes.
`bench/health` remains available for the much narrower health-handler test.

## Known differences

- Templates use `html/template`. Whitespace, attribute serialization, some canonical form-action
  URLs, and response headers/validators differ from Rust. Strict server/live DOM and network layers
  therefore still fail in many inventory cells, even when screenshots, accessibility and workflows
  match. These failures remain visible in the validation report. Exact protocol parity for malformed
  parameters and every content-negotiation edge case is not claimed.
- `GET /users/me/sidebar` currently returns only the sidebar frame, without the reference's
  application or Turbo-frame layout. Both historical and fork sidebar figures therefore measure
  the existing bare-frame handler, not a complete reference page. Unmerged upstream PR #4
  proposes a fix; the compression work does not incorporate that rendering change.
- WebSockets share serialized and compressed broadcast payloads through a small extension to
  coder/websocket v1.8.15 (see `third_party/websocket/README.campfire`). Outgoing queues hold 256
  frames; slow clients are disconnected. Authorization is checked afresh for each publication,
  batching distinct sessions per room. Rust uses different stream queues.
- Go ignores typing commands for rooms that have been deleted; Rust can still echo them to an
  already subscribed socket. The composer shows the same deleted-room message.
- The response cache uses least-recently-used eviction instead of Rust's sampled eviction. The Go
  message-fragment cache is also independently implemented. It retains versioned message lists
  and sidebar HTML; current membership and permission data are read before cache lookup.
  Room pages also cache their surrounding HTML keyed by fresh page data, inserting the current
  messages and the queried room's update timestamp on every request. Responses assemble cached
  message bytes with fresh page HTML and derive validators from part lengths and hashes, so ETag
  values differ from both the original Go implementation and Rust.
- Completed GET gzip bodies have a separate 32 MiB compression memo keyed by ordered part
  lengths, constructor-computed SHA-256 digests and gzip mtime, not weak ETags. Requests still run authentication, authorization and page queries;
  headers/cookies are never reused. No-store, writes, streams, bodies over 1 MiB and large compressed
  entries bypass retention. Zstd and streaming gzip retain their existing compression paths.
- The default version label and fallback VAPID subject identify `once-campfire-go`. Explicit version,
  VAPID keys and subject settings remain supported.
- Native host media output can differ with installed library versions. All byte-golden media tests
  pass with the pinned container libraries. Web Push is verified locally, not against external push
  providers.

As in Rust, background queues are bounded and in-process: graceful shutdown drains work, but a
process crash can lose queued jobs. See [the implementation record](plans/go-conversion.md) for
coverage and validation scope.
